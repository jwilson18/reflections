How did viewing a diff between two versions of a 
file help you see the bug taht was introduced?
By typing diff in command line I was able to see 
what lines were added/removed in the two versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history 
of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

You are able to look through the history to see where 
a bug was introduced.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually 
choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically 
saved, like Google
docs does?

If you automatically save, you do not have to worry about 
forgetting to save your changes.  However, manual saving 
makes sure that you don't end up with commits that are not useful.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat 
each file separately?

Because some files like html and css make sense to save together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view 
the history of files?

You can use git log to show the different commits made, and 
you can use git diff to compare the differences between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to 
make changes that
could break something?

The advantage of version control is that you can always just
 revert to a previous commit or find where things went wrong.
